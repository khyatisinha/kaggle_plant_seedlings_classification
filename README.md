# kaggle_plant_seedlings_classification
This is a kaggle plant seedlings image classification problem .

It consists of 12 classes of images for different plant seedlings species.
The model is preprocessed and trained using a convolutional neural network.
After two consecutive layers of convolution layer and max-pooling layer , a drop-out layer is added to get better results.
